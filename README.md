# Wordle App

* A simple React.js App that maps through the letters a user inputs and see if they match with the five-letter target word. It also highlights letters present but inputted at the wrong place of the target word yellow that helps the user gain information about the letters present in the target word while letters that are not in the target word are highlighted grey in accordance with the set word and mapping each input letter to each letter of the target word. The correctly guessed letters inputted at the right palce gets highlighted green using iterative comparison of letters.
